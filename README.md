# uniCoursesDatabase 2020
First website I ever made.

Main objective was to utilize PHP and MySQL to connect a backend database with a web front end. As well as the ability for users to make updates, insertions, deletions, and query the database from this front end.

The database itself was modelled after Western University course information, other Canadian university's course information, and a mapping of credit equivalencies for these courses.
